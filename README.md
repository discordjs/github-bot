# Usage

For folks with _write_ access to `discordjs/discord.js`, by leaving a comment on any PR:

```
@discord-js-bot pack this
```

the bot should leave a 👀 reaction on your comment, after which a `publish-dev` workflow will be triggered. Once that's done,
a comment will be left indicating success. If you receieve no feedback after a reasonable amount of time, it's possible the
workflow failed, or that the bot is open.

The bot can also be summoned by an existing comment via edits. Note that `@discord-js-bot pack this` must be the _start_ of the comment.
